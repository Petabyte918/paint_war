# PaintWar
PaintWar is a game developed in a multiplayer videogames course as a final project. Is the first game I developed! :smiley:

##Objective:
Paint more floor than your enemies!
Hint: If you draw a figure with fixed tiles on the floor, it will be filled!

##Instructions:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Open localhost:3000

WASD to move.

Enjoy!
