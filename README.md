# PaintWar
Paint War is an online multiplayer browser game where your objective is to paint more tiles than the enemy team. Is the first game I developed! :smiley:

Each time your player walks over a tile, it paints to your team color. If you walk 4 times over the same tile without being painted meanwhile by another team, the tile gets blocked for your team and cannot be stolen anymore. If you walk over a tile from another team, it paints as it were the first time you walk over it. If you create a closed figure of blocked tiles, all the non-blocked tiles inside the figure will be fixed of your team color.

Do you want to try it? [Play it on Heroku!](https://paintwar.herokuapp.com/)

## Objective:
Paint more floor than your enemies!

Hint: If you draw a closed figure with fixed tiles on the floor, it will be filled!

## Instructions:
```
npm install
npm start
```
Open localhost:3000

WASD to move.

Enjoy!
